      <AccordionItem title="Are you a member of any professional organizations?">
        <p>
          Yes. Arizona Family Connections is listed with SV Directory and the Supervised Visitation Network.

      <AccordionItem title="How much do you charge?">
        <p>
          Our supervised visitation and monitored exchange fees are billed hourly and are based on the number
          of children and the type of service provided. You can view current rates in our
          <a href="/#pricing" class="link-inline">pricing section</a>. If you have questions about your
          specific situation, please reach out and we’ll be happy to walk through costs with you.

      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="Do you provide transportation for children?">
        <p>
          Yes. A member of our team can pick up and drop off your child when transportation is needed for a
          visit or exchange. There is a transportation fee, and our staff can provide car seats when required.
          For details about routes and current rates, please contact our team or review our service and
          pricing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If transportation will be part of your plan, we recommend noting this during the intake process so
          we can plan accordingly.

      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="What types of services do you offer?">
        <p>
          We provide a range of services to support safe and structured parent–child contact, including
          supervised visitation, monitored exchanges, virtual/telephonic visits, transportation support, and
          related documentation such as objective reports and court testimony when appropriate.
        </p>

      <AccordionItem title="Where do visits take place?">
        <p>
          Visits can occur in a variety of settings depending on the case, including our office, approved
