      <AccordionItem title="Are you a member of any professional organizations?">
        <p>
          Yes. Arizona Family Connections is listed with SV Directory and the Supervised Visitation Network.
          We are also included in the RSAT and Second Chance Resource databases, and we are an active

      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="How much do you charge?">
        <p>
          Our supervised visitation and monitored exchange fees are billed hourly and are based on the number
          of children and the type of service provided. You can view current rates in our
          <a href="/#pricing" class="link-inline">pricing section</a>. If you have questions about your
          specific situation, please reach out and we’ll be happy to walk through costs with you.
        </p>
      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="Do you provide transportation for children?">
        <p>
          Yes. A member of our team can pick up and drop off your child when transportation is needed for a
          visit or exchange. There is a transportation fee, and our staff can provide car seats when required.
          For details about routes and current rates, please contact our team or review our service and
          pricing information.
        </p>
        <p>
          If transportation will be part of your plan, we recommend noting this during the intake process so
          we can plan accordingly.
        </p>
      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="What types of services do you offer?">
        <p>
          We provide a range of services to support safe and structured parent–child contact, including
          supervised visitation, monitored exchanges, virtual/telephonic visits, transportation support, and
          related documentation such as objective reports and court testimony when appropriate.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can learn more about each option on our
          <a href="/services/" class="link-inline">Services page</a>.
        </p>
      </AccordionItem>

      <AccordionItem title="Where do visits take place?">
        <p>
          Visits can occur in a variety of settings depending on the case, including our office, approved
          community locations, or other arrangements that support the safety and well-being of the child.
        </p>
        <p>
          Specific locations are determined during the intake and scheduling process. For a full overview of
          our supervised visitation and exchange settings, please visit our

      <AccordionItem title="How do I get started?">
        <p>
          To begin, complete our secure intake form so we can review your case details, court orders, and
          any safety considerations. Once we receive your information, our team will follow up to confirm
          eligibility, discuss available services, and get started with your first visit.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can start the process at any time on our
          <a href="/schedule/" class="link-inline">Schedule page</a>.

      <AccordionItem title="Do you offer services in Spanish?">
        <p>
          Yes. We can provide services and communication in both English and Spanish where needed. If you or
          a family member prefers Spanish, please let us know during intake so we can plan appropriate
          support.
